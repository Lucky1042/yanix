- fixed bug in vfs system (find inode by path) 
- changed the way to access read/write io (with vfs alone now)
- @todo: this system should actually use the vfs as a top layer so we should build a layer in between that rests on filedescriptors alone (for syscalls)
- added elf executable support/driver
- added execve syscall
- started using errno's 
@todo this should be used everywhere
- fixed bugs here and there
