So we figured out the last one here's the next one and he's tricky

so we have a bug if execute 

execve_user("/hello", 0, 0);

it works perfectly

but if we run:

  if (fork() == 0)
  {
    execve_user("/hello", 0,0 );
  }
  else
  {
    execve_user("/hello", 0, 0);
  }
  
only one runs and it's the next one that get's control so its not issolated to not
being the kernel run or something like that


ALSO
i found another bug

our KMALLOC is fucked
we expand the heap and those pages are in the kernel directory
buuuut
they aren't updated in our g_current_directory, which is bad?

we can fix this for a while by setting our heap initial size but it definitally is not a permenant fix
